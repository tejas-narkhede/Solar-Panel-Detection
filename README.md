# Solar-Panel-Detection

Hi Sir/Madam        
I am a TY CSE undergrad from SPPU. You might think I am giving an excuse but suerly I am not. 3 Days ago I got info regarding SRIP Internship at IIT Gandhinagar. I was really excited to fill application form. After reviewing hundreds of project I found sustanibility lab project intresting and more impacting and  I filled the application form. I checked the drive and reviewed the projects and task project, although it was a technological bummer for me, I have previously had worked on computer vision and image processing and also implemented OpenCV, CNN types and R-CNN but for Object Detection models like YOLO, DETER and others were next on my bucket list for my Space Debries mitigation projects. Frankly speaking I have less knowledge in object detecion models, and I am learning it for past two days.            
But if you please give me additional two day upto sunday evening or monday morning. I can promise you that I can finish my model and other activities and upload it fully on this repository in two days.         
I know I am late but please give me one chance I know I can do better.       
thank you
